Some of the variables include Credit Grade, Lender Yield, Borrower Rate and Borrower APR among others. This data is contained in a csv file downloadable from a udacity-hosted page[here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1581581520570000) with feature documentation available [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key%3D0AllIqIyvWZdadDd5NTlqZ1pBMHlsUjdrOTZHaVBuSlE%26usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1554486256024000).


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration some of the findings that I made include:
Over 80% of all Prosper Loans debtors are earning or earned more than $25,000 per year. In the same vein, over 80% of this same population were or are employed in some way. 
The majority of Prosper Loans -56,576 loans are current loans. This represents 49.7% of all their loans. Up to 10.5% of all loans were charged-off.
Prosper Loan Borrowers generally have or had a high credit rating, that is those with 5 and above accounted for more than half of all loans (58.1%). Prosper loans are quite profitable, with most of them having a profitabilty of between 10% and 25%.
Connecticut, Washington DC and New Jersey have the highest monthly incomes, while indiana, Maine and North Dakota are in the bottom 3. Utah, Massassuchets and Wyoming have the highest debt to income ratio, while New York, New Jersey and Washington DC have the lowest 3 values in that order. However, the top 3 states by average mean lender yield were Alabama, North Dakota and Indiana. The bottom 3 were Washington DC, Maine and Indiana.
Except for zero credit rating, the borrower rates, borrower APR and lender yields fell progressively with increasing credit ratings while investor numbers increased progressively with higher credit ratings. 
Debt to Income Ratio, Employment Status duration and Stated Monthly income remained at relatively stable levels accross all the credit grades.
People on full time jobs attracted the highest investor numbers and some of the lower interest loans. Unemployed folks had a staggeringly high debt to income ratios compared to other employment categories.
The completed loans had some of the lowest lender yields, comparable to current loans. Completed loans had some of the lowest rates, also comparable to current loans. These other 'bad' loans have higher interest rates.
Loans to Home owners had better yields across the credit categories compared to non-home owners, and investors preferred medium term loans the most, followed by longer term loans. They funded shorter term loans the least.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on the impact of important variables such as debt to income ratio, income range, employment status, etc. Most of the intermediate processing and data assessment are not included.

> I used color properly and ensured that I annotated my charts.
